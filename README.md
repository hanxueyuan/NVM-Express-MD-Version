# NVM-Express-MD-Version

## Project Introduction
This repository `NVM-Express-md-version` is dedicated to sharing the Markdown version of the NVM Express protocol, making it convenient for large language models (LLMs) to access. NVM Express is an interface standard for non-volatile memory (such as SSDs). This project converts its documentation into a more manageable Markdown format.

## Repository Structure
- `docs/`: Stores the Markdown documentation of the NVM Express protocol.
- `scripts/`: If there are documentation conversion scripts, they can be stored in this directory.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/yourusername/NVM-Express-md-version.git
```
2. Browse the Markdown files in the `docs/` directory to access the protocol documentation.

## Version Submission Plan
Currently, we are preparing to submit a new version to update the project status and documentation.

## Future Work Plan
In the future, we will gradually update the `NVM-Express-Base-Specification` to keep it in sync with industry standards.
